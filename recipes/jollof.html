    <h1>JOLLOF RICE</h1>
    <img src="../jollof-rice.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="500" />
    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>
      This West African favorite is bold, smoky, and richly flavored. The rice
      is simmered in a spicy tomato and pepper sauce until each grain is coated
      in bright red-orange color. It has layers of taste from onions, curry,
      thyme, and stock, giving it a deep savory kick. Traditionally, it’s served
      with fried plantain, grilled chicken, or beef. Jollof is often called a
      party rice because it’s so festive and irresistible.
